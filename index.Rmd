# Welcome! I am Ugo. 
  
</br>

##### I am 6 feet tall.

##### I enjoy reading, writing, and I am learning how to code. 

##### I do not like attempting all-nighters and I will graduate with my B.S. degree this year.  

##### I don't have any data-related projects either, but if I did you could find them [here](/portfolio)!
